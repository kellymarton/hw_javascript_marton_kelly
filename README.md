## Resources
[ESLint quotations option](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)

I used this to change the configuration of my ESLint settings from single to double so that I wouldn't get a ton of error messages.
## Deductions
I reviewed the list of deductions for this project and in the syllabus.
## Comments
I ended with one error in ESLint that I couldn't fix, even though I used the documentation to read through and try to understand ([here](http://eslint.org/docs/user-guide/configuring)). I'm frankly not sure if I understood the intention of that part of the assignment, despite getting it to work in the end.
